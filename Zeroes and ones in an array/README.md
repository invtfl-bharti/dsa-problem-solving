# Array Zero-One Counter

This repository contains a simple C++ program that prints an array and counts the occurrences of zeros and ones in it.

## Code Overview

### `printArray` Function

The `printArray` function takes an integer array and its size as input and prints the elements of the array.

### `countZeroOne` Function

The `countZeroOne` function takes an integer array and its size as input and counts the occurrences of zeros and ones in the array. It then prints the counts.

### `main` Function

In the `main` function, an example integer array `arr` is defined. The array is then printed using the `printArray` function, and the counts of zeros and ones are calculated and printed using the `countZeroOne` function.
